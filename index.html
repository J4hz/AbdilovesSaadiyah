        Today, I celebrate not just the day you were born, but the incredible person you are and all the joy you’ve brought into my life. From the moment I met you, my world became brighter, more beautiful, and filled with more love than I ever thought possible.
        
        Every moment with you is a treasure. Your smile, your laughter, the way you care for others, and the way you love me—all these things make me fall deeper in love with you every day. You mean everything to me, and I am so grateful to have you by my side.
        
        As you celebrate another year of your amazing life, I want you to know how deeply I cherish you. You are my best friend, my partner, my everything. I love you more than words can express, and I am so excited to continue this journey of life with you.
        
        Here’s to many more birthdays together, to endless laughter, love, and joy. Thank you for being the most wonderful person I know. I love you with all my heart, today and always.
        
        Happy Birthday, my love.</p>
